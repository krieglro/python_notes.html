                    <p>Indentation is key in python not just for readability but python uses indentation to show a block of code.</p>
                <li>    
                    <p>docstring - python document strings(or docstrings)provide a convenient way of        associating documentation with python modules,functions,classes,and methods.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>In python comment is made begining with # and everything after # is ignored.comments are used to let other programmers know what your code means.</p>

                    <p>A variable is how we give a name to something in python,variables are case sensitive hense the variable Car is not the same as variable car.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>In python there are two types of numbers ie intigers (int) which comprise of whole numbers eg 1, 23, 100 and float(float) nambers which have a decimal eg 1.0</p>

                    <ins>Complex</ins>: The complex() method returns a complex number when real and imaginary parts are provided, or it converts a string to a complex number.
                    the syntax of complex is ([real[, imag]]).

                    <ins>iterators</ins>:An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.an iterator is an object that can be iterated upon,meaning that you can traverse through all the values. Technnically,in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol,which consist of the methods __iter__ () and __next__().list,dictionaries,tuples,and sets are all iterable objects.They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.

                    <p><ins>type casting</ins>: Python type casting or type conversion,is a method of changing an entity from one data type to another.It is used in computer programming to ensure variables are correctly processed by a function. An ecample of typecasting is converting an integer to a string.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>In python you change things to intigers using the int() function and float using the float() function.</p>

                    <ins>functions</ins>: Classes and objects;Python is aan object oriented programming language.almost everythong in Python is an object,with its properties and methods.A class is like an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects.
                     to create a class,use the keyword -class-

                    <ins>working with dates</ins>:The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways.While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

                <li>
                    <ins>modules</ins>: Modules in python are simply Python files with a .py extension.The name of the mofule will be the name of the file.A Python module can have a set of functions, classes or varioables defined and implemented.

                <li>
                    <ins>Exeptional handling</ins>: The try and except block in python is used to catch and handle exceptions.Python executes code following the try statement as a normal part of the program.The code that follows the except statement is the program's response to any exceptions in the preceding try clause.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ins>File handling</ins>: File handling is an important part of any web application.
                    Python has sevaral functions for creating, reading, updating and deleting files.the key function for working with files in python is the open() function.

                <li>
                    <ins>Pip</ins>: Pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.
                    <p>Many packages can be found in the default source for packages and their dependencies.</p>
